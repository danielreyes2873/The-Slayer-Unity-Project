put the GameManager prefab into the scene,and in the player's script(maybe playerController?)

in the Awake()

(I create CharacterStats script, you can just put it on the player or enemy)
GameManager.Instance.RigisterPlayer(CharacterStats);

and after that, every script can access playerInformation by using

GameManager.Instance.playerStats.gameObject;

or using 

GameManager.Instance.playerStats.currentHealth....
